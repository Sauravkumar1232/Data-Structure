Stack<Data-Structure> stack_name = new Stack<>();

LIFO -> Last in First out
FILO -> FIRST IN LAST OUT

Three operationc on Stack 
Push(int) => insert ele at top =>  O(1)
Pop(void) => delete ele at top =>  O(1)
Peek(void) => return top ele   =>  O(1)

cant access ele directly

jb tk uper wala ele nhi hatega tn tk niche wala nhi access hoga

size increse/decrese at run time


Get the ele   TC    SC
Array         O(1)  O(1)      directly access ele                   size fixed
LL            O(n)  O(1)      one by one access ele                  variable size   
stack         O(n)  O(n)      first pop top ele and store other     variable size 
                              spac the access ele so SC O(n)        


Display stack recursivly

Reverse Stack
1=> Iteratively
2=> Recursively

UnderFlow 
 --->   if Stack is empty then pop() and peek() not possible give EmptyStackExeption

 OverFlow 
 --->   if  if Stack is full then push() not possible gives error  
        but Stack overflow generally occurs when memory is full because stack is variable size produce
